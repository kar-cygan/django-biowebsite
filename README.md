# Django BioWebsite

This web application was developed as part of a university course "Creating Web Applications in Django." The project aims to showcase a simple website equipped with various features related to science. 

The application includes the following components:

### News
The "News" section of the website offers up-to-date information by fetching news articles from APIs of scientific websites.

### Blog
The "Blog" section of the website allows users to explore and read articles related to science and other relevant topics.

### Tools
The "Tools" section provides users with handy utilities for processing DNA sequences.

- **Generate Random DNA Sequence**: Users can generate random DNA sequences of a specified length and specify the frequency of occurrence for each nucleotide. This feature is useful for testing and experimentation.

- **Sequence Content Analysis**: This tool allows users to analyze the composition of a DNA sequence by determining the number and percentage of subsequences of a selected size. This analysis can provide insights into the sequence's characteristics.

- **Reverse Complement**: This tool generates the reverse complement of a given DNA sequence, which is a fundamental operation in molecular biology.

- **DNA Translation**: This tool translates a given DNA coding sequence into a protein sequence. It employs the standard genetic code to map groups of three nucleotides (codons) to their corresponding amino acids.
